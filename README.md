## FAQ

### Do I have to use Docker?

No. You can use any WordPress install you want. Just make sure you follow [the documentation](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/blob/main/apps/docs/index.md) and have the Next.js WordPress Plugin and Theme, and WP GraphQL activated.

---

### So this repo will work on any WordPress install?

Yes. The [demo site](https://nextjswp.com/) is not running Docker. See above ^^

---

### Why Mantine and not Tailwind, MUI, or \_\_\_\_?

I did not want to create/maintain UI components like forms, notifications, etc. from scratch. See [this issue](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/issues/69#issuecomment-1426217207) for a more detailed explanation.

---

### Why Apollo and not \_\_\_\_?

While Apollo can sometimes introduce a large performance penalty, it was literally built for working with GraphQL... and _it works well_.

---

### When will you support the Next.js 13 `app` directory?

_As of March 2023, the `app` directory is still in `beta`_

First, The Next.js team [does not recommend using it in production](https://capture.dropbox.com/akVllqdUQTtzOPKd).

Second, Client-Side data fetching is [not supported](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/11a5vp9/comment/j9q0dx9/), and the limitations of React Context have been challenging.

Finally, Mantine (which uses Emotion) doesn't fully support Server Components yet (see [#2928](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2928) and [#2815](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/2815)).

Please understand that I am as equally excited about the `app` directory as you are! However, Server Components represent a complete paradigm shift for React-based projects. Refactoring this repo will require a lot of work. Don't worry, because `pages` directory will be around [for years to come](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/11a5vp9/comment/j9x3e4h/)!
