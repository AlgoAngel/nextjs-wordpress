## FAQ

### Do I have to use Docker?

No. You can use any WordPress install you want. Just make sure you follow [the documentation](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/blob/main/apps/docs/index.md) and have the Next.js WordPress Plugin and Theme, and WP GraphQL activated.

---

### So this repo will work on any WordPress install?

Yep! The [demo site](https://nextjswp.com/) is not running Docker. See above ^^

---

### Why Mantine and not Tailwind, MUI, or \_\_\_\_?

I preferred not to create or maintain complex UI components such as forms, notifications, dropdowns, and so on. The reason for this is explained in more detail in [this discussion](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/discussions/76#discussioncomment-5203206).

---

### Why Apollo and not \_\_\_\_?

Although Apollo can sometimes negatively impact performance, it was specifically designed for GraphQL and it is a reliable and effective tool for this purpose.

---

### When will you support the Next.js 13 `app` router?

> As of March 2023, the `app` router is still in `beta`.

There are two primary reasons why this repo hasn't already adopted the `app` router:

1. The Next.js team [does not recommend using it in production](https://capture.dropbox.com/ZXzRKgIruGnyF5wP)
2. Mantine (which uses Emotion) doesn't fully support Server Components yet (see [#2815](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/2815) and [#2928](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2928))

I understand that there's a lot of excitement around the new `app` router and Server Components in React-based projects. However, it's important to recognize that this represents a significant paradigm shift, and it will take time for the community to fully understand and adopt this approach. While refactoring to use Server Components is no small task, I am [exploring and experimenting](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-app-directory) with this new technology.

That being said, I want to assure you that the existing `pages` router is still a reliable and established approach in Next.js. It will continue to be around [for the foreseeable future](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/11a5vp9/comment/j9x3e4h/), and can still be used effectively for many use cases.
