## FAQ

### Do I have to use @wordpress/env?

Nah, you can use any WordPress environment you want. I've tested with LocalWP and Dreamhost and both work fine. Using [@wordpress/env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) is just a convient way to shared and automate the setup process.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you choose not to use [@wordpress/env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/), you'll need to to do quite a bit of manual setup as well as update some of the scripts in the `package.json` file.

### Why Mantine and not Tailwind, MUI, or \_\_\_\_?

I did not want to create or maintain complex UI components such as forms, notifications, dropdowns, and so on. The reason for this is explained in more detail in [this discussion](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/discussions/76#discussioncomment-5203206).

---

### Why Apollo and not \_\_\_\_?

Although Apollo can sometimes negatively impact performance, it was specifically designed for GraphQL and it is a reliable and effective tool for this purpose.

### When will you support the Next.js 13 `app` router?

This repository has not yet adopted the app router primarily because Mantine (which uses Emotion) doesn't _fully_ support Server Components yet (see [#2815](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/2815) and [#2928](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2928))

While there is considerable enthusiasm for the app router and Server Components in React-based projects, it is essential to acknowledge that Server Components represent a substantial shift in the development of React-based projects. It will inevitably take time for both the tooling and the community to embrace this approach fully.

Nevertheless, **the pages directory is stable and will continue to be actively supported in future versions of Next.js**. As a matter of fact, a VP at Vercel has publicly stated that the pages directory will be around for years to come[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/11a5vp9/comment/j9x3e4h/)]!

I am [actively exploring and experimenting](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-app-router-examples) with this new technology and am encouraged by the results. More information will be shared about this topic in the future.
